## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Requirements
- Python 3.13.5 (64-bit) or newer
- Dependencies:
  - `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `xlsxwriter`, `customtkinter`, `plyer`, `pywin32`, `numba`, `pyarrow`, `xlwings`

Use pip to install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter plyer numba pywin32 customtkinter xlwings pyarrow
```

> Windows-only features like `win32com.client` require `pywin32`.
> Async Excel support via `xlwings` will fallback to COM automation if necessary.

## üß™ Usage Guide

### Launch the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### Run a Performance Profile
```bash
python profile_runner.py
```
Generates `profile_stats.prof` and prints slowest calls.

## üîê Audit Logging

All scripts log user actions/errors to:

```
%OneDrive%/True Community - Data Analyst/Python Repricing Automation Program/Logs/audit_log.csv
```

If unreachable, logs fall back to:
```
local_fallback_log.txt
```

---

## üîß Configuration Management

To manage file paths centrally, update:

```json
file_paths.json
```

Or adapt `config_loader.py` to replace JSON with `.env` or `.toml` later if preferred.

---

## üßº Additional Notes

- Logs are rotated (`utils.log`) to avoid file bloat.
- All enhancements maintain full backward compatibility with your original logic.
- UI now supports full dark/light mode toggle and async Excel pasting with live progress.
- For setup, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration, see `SETUP_GUIDE.txt` and the walkthrough documentation.

For questions or future updates, contact your IT department or the program maintainer.

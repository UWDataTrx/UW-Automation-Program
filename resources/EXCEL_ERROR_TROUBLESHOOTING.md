# Excel Error Troubleshooting Guide

## "We found a problem with some content" Error

If you encounter an Excel error dialog saying **"We found a problem with some content in '[filename]_Rx Repricing_wf.xlsx'. Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can?"**, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### Immediate Solutions

#### Option 1: Allow Excel Recovery (Recommended)
1. **Click "Yes"** in the Excel dialog to let Excel attempt recovery
2. If Excel successfully recovers the file:
   - Save the file immediately (Ctrl+S)
   - Close and reopen the file to verify it works
   - If the file opens correctly, you can continue using it

#### Option 2: Delete Corrupted File and Restart
1. **Close the Excel error dialog** by clicking "No"
2. Navigate to your program directory (where the Python files are located)
3. Look for files ending with `_Rx Repricing_wf.xlsx` (e.g., `ClarionTechDM_Rx Repricing_wf.xlsx`)
4. **Delete the corrupted file**
5. **Restart the program** and run the process again

### Root Causes and Prevention

#### Common Causes of Excel File Corruption:
1. **Process Interruption**: The program was stopped while writing to Excel
2. **Multiple Excel Instances**: Having Excel open while the program runs
3. **Insufficient Disk Space**: Not enough free space to write the file
4. **OneDrive Sync Issues**: Network problems during file synchronization
5. **Memory Issues**: Running out of RAM during large data operations

#### Prevention Steps:

**Before Running the Program:**
1. **Close all Excel applications** completely
2. **Check available disk space** - ensure at least 1GB free
3. **Pause OneDrive sync** temporarily if on a slow network
4. **Close unnecessary programs** to free up memory

**During Program Execution:**
- **Don't interrupt the process** - let it complete fully
- **Don't open Excel** while the program is running
- **Monitor the progress bar** and wait for completion messages

**System Requirements:**
- **Free Disk Space**: At least 1GB available
- **RAM**: 4GB+ recommended for large datasets
- **Excel Version**: 2016 or newer
- **OneDrive**: Stable internet connection if using cloud sync

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### If Files Continue to Corrupt:
1. **Check system resources**:
   - Open Task Manager
   - Monitor memory usage during program execution
   - Close unnecessary applications

2. **Temporary local processing**:
   - Move the program folder to your local drive (C:)
   - Run the process locally
   - Copy results to OneDrive after completion

3. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter xlwings
   ```

4. **Check Excel installation**:
   - Repair Microsoft Office through Control Panel
   - Ensure macros are enabled
   - Update Excel to the latest version

#### File Recovery Options:
If you have a corrupted file that won't recover:

1. **Excel's built-in recovery**: 
   - Open Excel
   - File → Open → Browse
   - Select the corrupted file
   - Click the dropdown arrow next to "Open"
   - Choose "Open and Repair"

2. **Previous versions**:
   - Right-click the corrupted file
   - Select "Properties" → "Previous Versions"
   - Restore an earlier version if available

### Error Reporting

If the problem persists, please provide:
1. **Exact error message** (screenshot preferred)
2. **File size** of the corrupted file
3. **Available disk space** when the error occurred
4. **Program log files** from the Logs folder
5. **System specifications** (RAM, Excel version)

### Recent Improvements

The program now includes enhanced error handling:
- ✅ **Disk space checking** before Excel operations
- ✅ **Atomic file writing** (temporary files, then move)
- ✅ **File validation** after creation
- ✅ **Backup creation** for existing files
- ✅ **Better error logging** for troubleshooting

These improvements should significantly reduce the occurrence of corrupted Excel files.
